		<h1>Calculating portfolio returns</h1>
		<b> Published on 15 OCT 2024 </b>
		<h2>Returns without cash flows</h2>
        <p>
		Calculating the return of a portfolio is rather easy, as long as there are no cash flows involved.
		In this case, we only need the following input: initial value of the portfolio $V_0$, current value of the portfolio $V_t$ and a year fraction $\tau$.
		The year fraction $\tau$ will express how much time (in years) has passed between initial valuation at time $0$ and the current valuation at time $t$.
		The return $r$ is then,
		$$ r = \frac{1}{\tau}\left(\frac{V_t}{V_o} - 1\right). $$
		Alternatively, we can use continuous compounding interest $r_c$ which calculated as, 
		$$ r_c = \frac{1}{\tau}\log\left(\frac{V_t}{V_o}\right). $$
		In what follows, we will focus on $r$ not $r_c$.
		We will consider different ways to determine $\tau$ in the section "Day count conventions" below.
		</p>
        
		<h2>Returns with cash flows</h2>
		<p>
		The previous approach does not work when including cash flows.
		Increasing the amount of money that you invest or selling a part of the investment impacts the value $V_t$ and consequently the return $r$.
		This change in portfolio value is, however, not related to the market conditions.
		Therefore, it should not be reflected in the return $r$.
		</p>
		<p>
		Calculating the return of the portfolio including the cash flows, either in or out, can be done using money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) $r_{mw}$.
		The MWRR takes into account the timing and size of cash flows and is defined by following equation,
		$$ V_t = V_0(1 + r_{mw}\tau) + \sum_i C_i(1+ r_{mw} \tau_i),$$
		where $C_i$ are the cash flows (negative for withdrawals), $\tau_i$ is the year fraction between the cash flow date and valuation date $t$.
		Solving the equation for $r_{mw}$ gives,
		$$ r_{mw} = \frac{V_t - V_0 - \sum_i C_i}{ V_0\tau + \sum_i C_i \tau_i}.$$
		</p>
		<p>
		As an example, we consider a portfolio with initial value $V_0 = 20\ 000$ on January 1st, 2021, a value of $V_t = 40\ 000$ on July 1st, 2024 and cash flows as in the Table below.
		Ignoring the cash flows, this portfolio has a return of $r = 19\%$.
		The investor did, however, invest money over time and did even withdraw once.
		Using the equation for the money-weighted rate of return, we find $r_{mw} = 5.07\%$.

		<h2>Day count conventions </h2>
        <p>
		To calculate the return, we need a year fraction $\tau$. 
		It measures the amount of time that has passed in years. 
		For our calculation above, we used the day count convention ACT/365. 
		It implies that you count the actual (ACT) number of days between two days and divide by 365.
		The slash symbol implies division.		
		One can argue that this approach is incorrect, since not every year has 365 days. 
		It is, however, a convention not a law. 
		</p>
		<p>
		There are many other conventions to determine the year fraction: ACT/360, ACT/ACT, 30/360, etc.
